# Alarm Clock using YouTube Embed

I wanted to buy an alarm clock with the radio thing. I thought why not code it first?
here it is
it's ugly ik
but it works

## Todo:

- Somehow make the UX better
- it's not clicky enough, so make it more clicky in a sense that you know that something is happening.
- Deploy so other people can use this without installing it in their own pc.
- Proper code docs so I don't forget what everything means
