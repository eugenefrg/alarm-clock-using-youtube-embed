# Alarm Clock using YouTube Embed

I wanted to buy an alarm clock with the radio thing. I thought why not code it first?
here it is
it's ugly ik
but it works
this can be used with any youtube video, and I intend to use it with radio station livestreams.

## Todo:

- Somehow make the UX better
- it's not clicky enough, so make it more clicky in a sense that you know that something is happening.
- Deploy so other people can use this without installing it in their own pc.
- Proper code docs so I don't forget what everything means
- Why not a list of embed codes for existing radio stations with youtube livestreams?
- also a list of sounds that can be tested? (maybe this is a separate feature)
